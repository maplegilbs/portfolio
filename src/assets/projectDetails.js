            descriptionLong: 'Maple sugaring is a challenging endevor due to the nature of the harvest.  A window of approximately 6 to at best 8 weeks is when producers make 100% of their crop.  This means when the weather is favorable, all systems must be operational.  Equipment downtime, issues in the woods, lost sap, these are all things that can ruin a season, and keep sugarmakers up at night. For Bear Cobble Sugarworks, this meant having a single reliable location to go and track this information was a necessity.  The solution: Bear Cobble HQ.',

            descriptionLong: 'Whitewater kayaking in the state of Vermont is about as weather dependent as any recreation endeavor can be.  In the dry season a rainstorm can bring opportunity measured in hours.  As such kayakers are constantly honing methods to determine if conditions are right.  Creek VT has made the next step in the evolution of these methods.  By integrating existing publically available resources and real-time information with their own system of capturing remote visuals, kayakers in the state now have a one-stop shop for determining when their favorite river has enough water to paddle.
